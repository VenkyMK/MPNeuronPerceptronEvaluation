# MPNeuronPerceptronEvaluation - This is the project to evaluate MP Neuron and Perceptron differences along with the following.
1. Change the test and training size values and study the corresponding impact
2. Change the threshold of the binarisation and study the corresponding impact
3. Plot the parameter space in the X-axis and Accuracy (Train and Test) in the Y-axis and study the same
4. Changing the hyper parameters, different combinations of epochs and learning rate and study the same
5. Use random initializer for w and b, Use seed to re-produce the scenario
6. Use animated plots and check if it could be applied for any of the hyperparameters
